$ This is a test configuration for the DAnalysis analyser/skimmer
$ Comments can be added following a "$"
$
$ The first part described the general configuration of the analyser
$ The output directory will be created in the directory the analyser is
$ run from
$ The output file will be created within the output directory and will
$ contain any histogram that was initialised (see skelton analyser sourcecode)
$ It is also possible to create a flat ntuple or a skim. In this case,
$ each sample will result in a unique output file containing the ntuple or skim.
$ In addition, a new configuration file (like this) will be created that allows 
$ to run over the new skim/ntuple with the DAnalysis framework, too, taking
$ care of proper normalisation etc.

$ The luminosity is to be given to match the cross section values listed in the section "inputfiles"
$ In this example, the cross sections are given in fb.
$ In other cases that may be pb and the luminosity value here needs to be multplied by 1000.

    Lumi       = 3000
    
$ If the testmode is activated, only a fraction of the events will be processed.
$ This mode is meant to test histogram ranges etc. The scaling does not necessarily
$ correspond to the relative cross sections of the processes
    
    Testmode   = true

$ Maximum number of child processes that are spawned simultaneously, each running on a
$ different input file.
    
    Maxchilds  = 6

$ This Samplesdir can be a local directory or refer to off-site locations via xrootd

$ The analyser will have a postProcess() function. This function should be used to
$ extract parameters from the filled histograms, do additional calculations, etc.
$ If only this post process function should be run (the histograms are already created)

[inputfiles-begin]

$ The input files are defined here. The syntax is the following (separated by ","):
$ 
$ 1) File name relative to Samplesdir
$    This can also be a directory relative to Samplesdir. In this case, all *.root files
$    in it will be considered.
$ 2) Legend name (can contain "#" for root-latex)
$ 3) Color of the contribution (in root definition)
$ 4) Cross section of the process
$ 5) Number of events that were generated. Can be set to "auto" or 0 for automatic determination
$    Automatic determination emplies that there are no preselection cuts!
$    In case, a full directory is defined as input (see bullet 1), the total number of events
$    in all files is considered.
$ 6) Legend order: The order the samples will appear in a stack plot if the "stackPlotter"
$    from the DAnalysis framework is used. Numbers don't need to follow one another 
$    (see last line)
$ 7) Optional signal indicator. In case the signal has to be treated differently in the event loop
$    this can be indicated here and later checked in the loop.
$ 8) Optional other options (not used for now)
$
$ Most of these options are not important when converting delphes to Phase2 NTuples. Just pick any values:
$ e.g. : <insample>, <legendname=outfilename>,  <color: does not matter>, <xsec: does not matter>, <nevents: does not matter>, <legend order: does not matter>,

$ This will process all root files in this directory:
TOP-PhaseIISummer17wmLHEGENOnly-00027_200PU/  , TGJets,   1, 56, auto, 2 


$ The last entry is an example for running over all input files in a directory
