This directory contains the code to produce an ntuple in the same format as
from the NTupler in this repository based on Delphes output for simple
mixing of FullSim and Delphes samples.

For setup please run setup.sh (having set up the CMS environment 'cmsenv') from this directory.
This will compile the package. THIS IS ONLY NEEDED ONCE!

After that (having set up the CMS environment 'cmsenv') 
'source env.sh' 
for usage.

The converter executable 'ntupler' can be found in 
PhaseTwoAnalysis/delphesInterface/ntupler

the executable is run using a configuration script. A documented example can be found in:
PhaseTwoAnalysis/delphesInterface/ntupler/configs/testConfig.txt

Please make sure the 'Outputdir' points to a directory with sufficient space. Also
notice that in the testConfig.txt, the test mode is enabled (running on just a few events).
This needs to be set to false.

A batch script is not included. The converter is very fast, and it is likely it can be
run interactively. It will utilise up to 6 CPU cores. This number can be adjusted in 
the configuration file. 
If batch submission is desired, a individual configuration file 
for each job needs to be generated and passed to the 'ntupler' executable.
