Repository for collecting recipes for standard physics objects with for analysis of simulated events with the CMS phase 2 detector.
=========================


Contains (in the future)

a) scripts to set up the correct CMSSW environment

b) a collection of latest recipes and a CMSSW config to apply them to get collections of standard objects suitable for physics analysis

c) an ntuple production configuration file that produces an ntuple that can be analysed in a similar manner als Delphes samples (with the DAnalysis framework)
